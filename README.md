### Hello! 👋

- 🌱  I am always learning new ways to work in languages like Python, Java, C++, and Swift. My current fascination is with Natural Language Processing and UX/UI design.
- 👩‍💻  Professionaly, I have experience as a full-stack software developer with [BlocksForEarth](https://github.com/WildChainDevs), a startup NFT marketplace for zoos and museums. I am looking for full-time work as a software developer/engineer; reach out!
- 🎵  In my free time, I enjoy learning how to produce music and speak Korean.
