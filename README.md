### Hello! 👋

- 👩‍💻  Professionaly, I am a part-time full-stack software developer with [WildChain](https://github.com/WildChainDevs), a startup NFT marketplace for zoos and museums! Looking for full-time work as a software developer.
- 🎵  In my free time, I enjoy learning how to produce music and speak Korean.
